WHAT: Problem do we solve?
Below are the pain points that have been identified for Susan. If these change, we will need to adjust our product offerings (The HOW) and the operational strategy (In What Way); this impacts our roadmap (When).

Current State Flow (Without Necta):

Susan, as a hiring manager, begins her recruitment process by manually creating job listings and posting them on job boards like Seek.
She receives numerous applications, which she has to manually screen and shortlist based on the provided resumes and cover letters.
Susan spends significant time scheduling and conducting interviews, often facing challenges in aligning the availability of candidates and interview panel members.
Once the interview process is completed, Susan engages in lengthy negotiations with selected candidates regarding contract terms and conditions.
In cases where she seeks external recruitment assistance, Susan engages expensive recruitment agencies that charge high fees and may not fully understand her specific talent requirements.
The process of coordinating with recruitment agencies involves communication delays, limited control over the selection process, and potential misalignment in finding the right candidate.
Pain Points:

Time-Consuming: Susan spends excessive time creating job listings, reviewing resumes, and scheduling interviews, taking her away from other critical tasks.
Inefficient Candidate Screening: Manual screening of resumes and cover letters is prone to errors and may result in missing out on potentially suitable candidates.
Costly and Limited Options: Engaging expensive recruitment agencies restricts Susan's options and can be a financial burden on her organization.

Market Alternatives and Unique Selling Proposition (USP): In the current market, hiring managers like Susan typically rely on traditional methods like job boards or expensive recruitment agencies. However, Necta offers a unique value proposition that sets us apart:



Advanced Technology: Necta leverages AI and machine learning algorithms to automate and streamline the entire recruitment process, significantly reducing the time and effort required by Susan.

AoG Talent Acquisition

Sales Backlog
Our goal is to efficiently connect talented individuals with organisations, providing an intuitive, user-friendly platform powered by AI. We achieve this by partnering with recruiters, referred to as Client Engagement Consultants (CECs), who build and maintain relationships with clients, while we assist with leads, a machine learning platform to reduce administration, finance, and insurance to enable successful candidate placement.



Client Engagement & Obtainment:
Our CECs establish strong relationships with clients, understanding their talent needs. This individual ownership of client relationships ensures personal and high-quality service. Necta Assist members will assist CECs with cold calling new clients, marketing for candidates and setting up agreements with organisations. 

CEC's are responsible for maintaining relationships with their clients, to ensure fairness, once a contact has engaged a Necta CEC, they will own that relationship until the contact notifies Necta of their wish to move. However, this does not extend to the organisation, it does mean that if the contact changes organisation, the relationship is kept. 



Client Requirement Analysis:
CECs work with clients to create job descriptions and specifications, which are uploaded onto our Necta platform.

Candidate Sourcing:
Necta Assist leverages AI technology to search through our candidate database, the CECs' networks, and social media platforms. CEC's generate a comprehensive long list of suitable candidates.

Candidate Evaluation:
We deploy our bidirectional evaluating algorithm that assesses and ranks candidates based on their skills, behaviour, and culture-fit to the job description. CEC's use their wealth of experience to fine tune the model, interview the candidate and send two Necta in depth CV's. HERE you can find a template for CV generation if a CEC wanted to do it manually, 

Shortlisting:
We shortlist the top two candidates who best match the role and the client's requirements and present them to the client within five working days. If there has been no candidates found, an email update with the reasons why and actions you will take. 

Background Checks & Interviews:
Necta has tesimonials built in, however, a CEC may need from time to time request manual references, Necta Assist Administration will do this. Providing references should be using appropriate template HERE. If any psychometrics are required to ascertain the best fit from a human perspective, it is up to the Necta administrators to handle this and provide to the CEC to implement in the post interview template. 

Onboarding:
Once a client selects a candidate, the CEC will handle the onboarding process with the client with the Necta Administrator handling any backend paperwork, Necta Finance will ensure invoices are set up. For contract roles, the candidate must be uploaded to necta for timesheeting and the hiring manager will have the choice if they want to sign up or recieve simple timesheet approval. Payroll is automated, Necta Finance will audit all timesheets and invoices to ensure accuracy. The CEC will still provide relationship services to the candidate and the client throughout the engagement. 

This process ensures a faster, smarter, and simpler recruitment process, addressing Susan's pain points of time-consuming traditional hiring processes and inefficient candidate screening.


External Talent Procurement / Onboarding Talent Process Diagram
Necta Assist Process and Procedure notes are below:



Client Engagement:

Cold Leads can be obtained by Necta Administrators "to meet our senior client engagement consultant (CEC)", the lead is placed onto a backlog for any CEC within the region to take. A CEC will only see this lead if they are in the location where practical, they could visit face to face. (This does not mean that a CEC is not responsible or accountable for finding leads and relationship building, Necta Administrators are there to assist you, not to fulfill all leads. CEC have unique, local and an expert way of obtaining leads)

A CEC can only have five leads in motion at any one time from Necta. This ensures that over commitment isn't created and creates a time bound action to move the client to an engagement or to say they are not ready yet

Necta Administrators will take "not ready yet" and continuously follow up until they are ready, if the client requests a specific CEC, it'll go back to that CECs queue, if not, it'll go to the standard queue to be picked up by anyone with capacity

Once an engagement has been engaged, that relationship is now owned by the CEC, there is no limit to the number of relationships you can own as a CEC. 

However, it is recommended that CECs keep within their time capacity to maintain relationships AND still fill opportunity 

Necta Administrators will continuously send the relationship information with your name on to help

It is expected that every CEC will bill $100k NZD per year, anything less will need discussions with the Product Owner of Necta Assist

It is recommended to focus 70% of time working on active engagements and 20% relationship building and only 10% on new leads. Too much time allocated to taking more leads or creating more leads, can result in losing relationships that you already have or not filling the engagements you have. 

Please note that any relationship that a CEC is trying to land engagements with, are owned by the CEC, however, they are part of the five limit to ensure focus on delivering outcomes. Once the relationship contact has given the CEC an opportunity, that relationship is then solely owned by the CEC and is NOT part of the five in progress limit. 

Primary Consultant Engagement (CEC): Engage with the client to understand their hiring needs, establishing a strong relationship and obtaining a comprehensive job description.

Leads for client engagement comes from website forms, marketing pipeline, direct to CEC or through cold calling from the CEC or secondary consultant at Necta

If a client wishes to engage Necta for the first time, ensure that Necta Administrators send a contract, a template can be found HERE. Progress may continue; however, this will be followed on continuously until it is signed. 

Clients may not give a Job Description; it may be a snippet of what they are looking for. It is up to the CEC to ensure the right questions are asked to get a round view of the outcomes they want. Necta administrators or the CEC can run our AI script to generate a JD. 

Job Specification: Analyse the job description to identify key skills, qualifications, working conditions, and remuneration expectations.




​​​​​​​Job Posting Creation:

Job Opportunity Creation on Necta: Create a job opportunity on the Necta platform. This includes creating a relevant job title, a clear job description, and indicating the qualification level, salary, and benefits.

Post this opportunity on Necta, this allows all Necta staff to see and help you achieve your goals of finding the right person. Necta members with Assist access, can assign candidates to your opportunity if they are aware of it. This does not cause any automation; it only allows you to see the profile and message them direct. 

Swipe right on any candidate that meets the criteria. You have the ability to find their email or phone number to jump start the process if required. 

Local Advertising: Advertise the job on local job boards, websites, and LinkedIn.

If the Necta platform is not providing response send the job ID to the Necta Administrator who will ensure social media automation is completed to help you achieve the right candidate in time. They will also post on free boards with CVs coming to you as a first point of contact.

The Necta Administrator will also add these candidates to our system so that others can find them. 

If required (a lack of candidates for this role type) funding will be provided for paid platforms. With a repeat of 2.b.b

Candidate Sourcing & Evaluation:

System AI Screening: Use Necta's AI algorithm to screen and match resumes to the job posting. This process analyses the CVs for job titles, skills, experience, and other relevant criteria.

Please remember we need the candidate to either swipe right on our opportunities, our terms state we can show their CV or on messenger, we need written consent that Necta can represent them for this specific opportunity. 

CEC Review & LongListing: The CEC reviews the matches generated by Necta's AI and creates a LongList of the most suitable candidates. If no suitable candidates are found, the process returns to 2.b.c

CEC will interview all members of a LongList or outsource this to the Necta Administrator with specific questions you wish to ask. 

Each candidate that is interviewed, comments need to be added to the system to ensure this helps others

Our system will allow you to re-write the candidates CV automatically into an appropriate Necta format and highlighting the candidates skills for THAT specific opportunity. Do not use the CV again, always generate new. Necta Administration can manually create these if needed. It will require character and cultural understanding from you. The top two candidates will be chosen to be sent to the Client

Every candidate interviewed will get a response to keep up to date. 

Please use the Necta system to generate an AI email to the client with the CVs attached. If you want this done manually, you may ask a Necta Administrator to ensure an email is created that match the CV and the opportunity.                                                                                    

Candidate Screening & Interviews:

Background Checks: The CECs and administrators initiate background checks, including verification of the candidates' credentials, and clearance to work in NZ. This may also involve Ministry of Justice criminal record checks. This is started for all candidates that have been chosen to be interviewed. 

Be aware that references or testimonials can be hard to gather until after the fact

Candidate Contact: Contact shortlisted candidates to confirm their availability for an interview and interest in the role.

Interview Scheduling & Execution: Schedule and conduct interviews with the candidates. This could be done by internal Necta consultants or the Necta Administrator.

Follow up on interviews. The system will tell you if interviews have been accepted, the CEC should contact the candidate the day before to ensure they are ready. Two hours after the interview has commenced, the CEC will ring the client contact to obtain feedback and then the candidate.

Candidate Selection & Onboarding:

Client Feedback & Final Selection: Based on the interview feedback, identify the final candidate(s) with the client.

Ensure all the pre-onboarding is settled. Leverage Necta administrators as needed. 

Contract Offer: Send the selected candidate a contract offer through Necta, including all necessary details about the job engagement.

Some clients will want to send contracts themselves

Some negotiation will be the responsibility of the CEC

Candidate Onboarding: Once the candidate accepts the offer, the CEC and administrators coordinate to handle onboarding paperwork, setting up invoicing and ensuring a smooth transition for the candidate into their new role.

Invoicing will be automatic if it's through Necta, however, it is best to CC finance to ensure this has happened if it was manual

If this engagement is a contract, the contractor will need to be signed up to necta, administrators will follow up, the employer needs to decide if they wish to sign up, if they do not, we can envoke email based timesheet approvals. Be aware that they will have limited access to reports. 

Timesheets will trigger invoices automatically 

Post-placement care:

Ongoing Support: Provide ongoing support to the candidate and the client, including regular check-ins, performance management, mental health and wellbeing care, and assistance with compliance and record-keeping.

Relationship Management: Continue to foster relationships with the client for future opportunities.

Financial 

Necta administrators, the platform AI and Necta finance are paid remuneration in line with the position they hold

CECs are what we call external employment, although they are an employee of Necta, they run their own independent process. As such, as long as the process is followed above, the branding, people and regulatory requirements are met then the income derived from their clients is allocated to them, with 30% fee being added. Therefore the 70% of the revenue derived from the client will be transferred to the CEC

Finance assume a $180k wage and therefore will help you with either getting a tax rebate at the end of the year or accurately ensure the last payment has the correct amount of yearly tax. 

If a secondary consultant is involved, the split is always 50:50 for the 70% revenue. This is automated and can not be changed 

If another CEC supplies a candidate to a relationship contact owned by someone else, this will result in a 50:50 split of the 70%, the same as if you have engaged a secondary consultant

Necta does not own candidates. They are free to be contacted by anyone if available

However, any candidate that has the status Engaged, Interview or Contract can not be contacted. These three statuses mean they are either in a Necta engagement or progressing on one. 

CEC do not own clients or roles. It is relationship based. If the hiring manager leaves, your relationship continues. 

Necta may not remove a relationship other than if the client requests a new CEC

If a client requests a new CEC this does not stop the previous CEC obtaining income from previous contracts signed, however, new engagements and income will be assigned to a new CEC. 

RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) model for the proposed process:

The Necta Assist Product Owner focuses on ensuring the processes and allocation is fair between CECs, to listen to the CECs & administrators to find ways of reducing administration and reducing time to market, increasing the amount of billing per person and ensuring more people obtain fulfilling work.

Necta Assist Features

Assist Dashboard

Send Invoices
Necta Assist works closely with the Necta Platform team, we own specific features that only members with a Necta assist account can access. 

This means our features are not available to Internal Talent Managers or Hiring Managers. 

Our access is designed to turn Necta Platform into a fully automated and conditional applicant tracking system from end to end. 

Assist Dashboard 

This allows the CEC to see the progress of their clients, earnings to date and predicted earnings in the future based on client progression. 

Send Invoices 

Necta Assist users have the ability to push the opportunity to invoice stage if there is a need to do outside of the system. This notifies the finance team and ensures compliance 

View Passport & MOJ

Assist users will see the files the user has updated on their profile page, if there isn't one, the assist users can request from the candidate from within the profile page. This gives them an email to remind them to upload a passport picture and to complete their MOJ process and upload. 

Interviews

Normal users can not choose a different email address for interviews. Assist can set up interviews with the candidate themselves or send them to the client. When sending to the client, it sets up an interview with the two individuals and not yourself. 

Assist Opportunities 

When creating an opportunity as an assist user, you can add the client details, the terms of the arrangement to ensure billing, timesheets and communications is efficient. 

JD Creator 

When creating an opportunity, assist users will be able to leverage AI to create a professional necta JD for the role. Which can be posted on third party sites or given to the client. 

Obtain References 

Although testimonials are built in, within the profile page, you will be able to remind the user to complete their testimonials OR if the candidate has provided references, you can set up an automatic email to obtain the references over email, which will update their testimonials. This does not prohibit you from ringing up for references if the time does not allow. 

Necta CMS

We keep all contacts within our system to ensure that the invoicing is created properly for our CEC. When you take from the leads board, you are limited to five in progress. The stage is LEAD during this process, however, when a LEAD turns into a CLIENT (by giving an opportunity to work on), they are removed from the kanban and appear under your name as a CLIENT contact. Automatic emails to build relationships can be switched on or off, however, reminders to maintain relationships will help you ensure a continuous relationship to help them obtain the talent they need. If a CEC has not received a paid commission from the CLIENT within 6 months, the CLIENT is open to all CECs without shared commission. 

Leads Kanban (Cold, Backlog, InProgress)

Cold stage allows anyone to place contacts to be approached by the administration, they can not be claimed until they are in the backlog column. A simple Kanban board that shows contacts that have expressed interest in talking to a CEC (Backlog); these are created by the CEC or the administrator. If IN PROGRESS, this means a CEC is currently trying to turn the lead into a client, work in progress limit per CEC is five. Once a Client, they will disappear, they can be moved back to backlog, where a CEC will add comments and they will go back to Cold Stage.

AI CV and Email to Client 

Emails are automated here at Necta, however, you can edit the emails before sending. They will be generated automatically by AI, however, you may want to send them manually and thus can copy and paste into your email system. All emails sent via our system are recorded so that we can keep an audit for our contracts. 

When sending a CV, the AI will re-write the CV to match the job opportunity better, allowing the candidate to put their best foot forward. The emails when sending the CV to the client, will also look at the opportunity and the CV to ensure a suitable email. 

Send Contracts

Small difference for assist users, allows contracts to be sent by our system as a necta contract (contractor) or as an upload for perm for the client. If the employer who wanted the contractor isn't signed up, this will trigger (once signed) an email for them to "claim" their account for managing contractors from now on. 

For perm, once this is signed and uploaded, it will be sent to the client with a follow up invoice based on the terms you have placed on the opportunity. 

Add To Opportunity 

Assist users can choose a candidate from the talent page and assign them to the opportunity for the assist user to see. No emails will be made to the candidate, but the assist user will have the ability to see their profile, message them, set up interviews and send contracts. 

Add Candidates 

Sometimes we get given CVs, and they do not want to sign up. We can add a candidate ourselves, and they will go into the system as deactivated, however, assist users can still progress them through the system. For contractors, they will need to "claim" their account before timesheets can begin. 

Talent Page

Assist users have access to our entire global database, with the ability to search, filter and see profiles of any user.

1.1.2 Create Opportunity Requirements

The Primary Consultant will assess the Job Description of the Opportunity and identify the key desired skills and qualifications required; this should be undertaken with help from the Client/Prospective Employer. Evaluation of the Work environment, Salary range and any other factors that may impact the candidate’s response and decision. The assessment should include an analysis of the job market to see if the job opportunity is competitive in terms of salary, benefits, and other job opportunities.

1.1.3 Create Job Opportunity on Necta

1.1.5 System AI - See Results / Make Offers

Our Machine Learning (AI) Algorithm is a powerful tool used in our Recruitment Process, that matches CVs and resumes to job openings by analysing the CV and comparing job titles, skills, experience, and other criteria most relevant to the job opening. Using the Necta Job Opportunity Created in 1.1.3, Nectas AI will create a list of potential matches, with Percentages of compatibility to the job opportunity, that we can then review and analyse.

1.1.6 Suitability?

The Primary Consultant will need to review and analyse the Potential Matches returned through Nectas AI. If one (or more) of these candidates are suitable then we can proceed to step 1.1.11, If no returned candidates are deemed to be suitable for the job opportunity, then proceed to step 1.1.7.

CEC Process

Michael Law
Review your calendar for any scheduled meetings, interviews or calls.
Review your task list and prioritise your activities for the day.
Check and Prioritise your Emails and Messages: Go through any overnight messages or emails that might require your immediate attention. Urgent client queries or requests should be prioritised.
Assess Your Current Vacancies: Review the status of the current vacancies you are working on. Identify which roles require urgent attention, and plan your tasks accordingly.
Daily Catch-up with Your Team: Have a quick meeting with your team to understand the status of their roles, and see if they need any support or resources from you.
Cold Calling/Emailing Potential Clients: This could be a task that you perform daily or set aside specific days for, depending on your schedule.
Prepare a list of potential leads to reach out to: Identify potential clients in your industry who may benefit from your recruitment services. (can use our spreadsheet under sales)
Reach out to these potential clients via a phone call or email. If you don't receive a response, follow up after a week.
Aim to gather some response from everyone, even if its no, not interested or to give out the information. 
Follow-Up on Earlier Contacts: If you have reached out to potential clients previously, make sure you follow-up with them regularly. This could be a phone call or an email to check if they have any current hiring needs.
Networking: Spend some time every day connecting with industry professionals on platforms like LinkedIn. This is a great way to generate new leads and stay up-to-date with industry trends.
For leads that are not clients, continuous checking in with them by email and phone but without the need to look desperate. 

Email Follow-Ups: You can check in with clients by email around once every quarter (3-4 times a year). This allows you to remain present in their minds without appearing overly aggressive or spammy. It's also a good idea to vary the content of your emails, sometimes sharing industry updates, tips, or new services you offer. (January, April, July, October)
 

Phone Follow-Ups: Phone calls are more personal and should be used sparingly to avoid being intrusive. An ideal frequency would be twice a year, typically mid-year and at year-end, when organisations often review their hiring needs and plans (June and December)

Schedule and conduct initial interviews with interested candidates.
Based on your interviews, select the top candidates to move forward in the process.
Interview questions, go to ChatGPT to create:

"Given a job profile for a [Job Title] with the following requirements [List Key Job Requirements] and a candidate with the following experience and skills [List Key Candidate Experience and Skills], please generate a list of interview questions to:

Evaluate if the candidate's skills and experience match the job requirements.
Understand the candidate's career aspirations and check if this job aligns with what they truly want.
Additionally, prepare some behavioral and situational questions to assess the candidate's problem-solving abilities, cultural fit, and interpersonal skills.

Here's a simple example for a Data Analyst role:

Prompt for GPT:

Given a job profile for a Data Analyst with the following requirements:

Proficiency in SQL and Python
Experience with data visualization tools like Tableau or Power BI

Please generate a list of interview questions to:

Evaluate if the candidate's skills and experience match the job requirements.
Understand the candidate's career aspirations and check if this job aligns with what they truly want.
Also, prepare some behavioral and situational questions to assess the candidate's problem-solving abilities, cultural fit, and interpersonal skills.

Present your top candidates to the client, and coordinate any further interviews or evaluations they require (chatGPT)
For interviews, book them but continuously follow up with candidates to see if they need anything (to reduce no shows) 
Prompt for GPT:

Given a job profile for a [Job Title] with the following requirements [List Key Job Requirements] and two candidates:

Candidate 1: [Provide a brief profile of Candidate 1 including their key skills, experiences, and other relevant details]

Candidate 2: [Provide a brief profile of Candidate 2 including their key skills, experiences, and other relevant details]

Please draft an email introducing these top candidates to the client. The email should separately summarize why each candidate suits the role, highlighting their key qualifications, experiences, and skills that align with the job requirements.

For example, if you are presenting two candidates for a Software Engineer role, your prompt might look like:

Prompt for GPT:

Given a job profile for a Software Engineer with the following requirements:

Proficiency in Java and Python
Experience with cloud platforms like AWS or Google Cloud
Strong problem-solving abilities and teamwork skills
And two candidates:

Candidate 1: Jane Doe, a software engineer with 4 years of experience working with Java and Python. She has built applications on AWS and is known for her exceptional problem-solving skills and teamwork.

Candidate 2: John Smith, a software engineer with 3 years of experience, proficient in Python and has some experience with Java. He has a Google Cloud certification and is recognized for his innovative solutions and strong collaboration skills.

Please draft an email introducing these top candidates to the client. The email should separately summarize why each candidate suits the role, highlighting their key qualifications, experiences, and skills that align with the job requirements.

Once a candidate has been selected by the client, coordinate with Necta administrators to handle all onboarding paperwork and procedures.
Remind the candidate they are starting and see how they are feeling

Reflect on your accomplishments for the day and identify any areas for improvement or learning.
 

 

 

 

Remember, being a CEC is not just about filling vacancies. It's about building relationships, understanding the needs of your clients and candidates, and providing a quality service that positions you and Necta as trusted partners in the recruitment process.

 

This list outlines your daily activities as a CEC at Necta. Remember, every day will be different, and you need to be flexible and responsive to the needs of your clients and candidates.

To assist in automating this process, you can use productivity tools to schedule your tasks and reminders for each step in the process. You can also create script templates for regular communication with clients and candidates.

 

For marketing material, work with Necta administrators or use online design tools to create compelling job postings, email newsletters, and social media posts that highlight your opportunities and the benefits of working with Necta.

   (e) The CoE may, by giving at least 20 Business Days’ notice to the Provider, vary the then-current applicable Administration Fee at any           time during the Term, and the Provider will correspondingly vary the Administration Fee payable under each Services Order with immediate effect.

(c) If a Participating Agency has received a curriculum vitae (CV) from multiple providers on the Panel for the same Candidate, the following applies:

(e) The Participating Agency may seek a copy of the Candidate’s written consent from the Provider and if necessary, cross-check it with the Candidate to ensure the consent is valid.
